\n\n  Very very pathetic...My son lost  1kg  weight  due to loss of sleep  and continues  crying during nite....The diaper was not of gud quality at all...I am a regular  customer  of Amazon and I hav given  a gud rating  for all my products purchased  till date...This is first time I'm giving  a negative  remark. the product  has to b extra  durable  and of gud quality  since we r using  it for the little  ones ..Very very disappointed..Amazon  cannot  do anything...Huggies  management  has to correct  and fulfill the needs ..I don't know  I selected  Huggies  on luking  at the  ratings and reviews but it didn't  fulfill my need...\n\n,1.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 28 September 2018
"\n\n  Don't Buy it. Last month we have used the same product but no issue, But this month company made the changes in manufacturing like bubble shape under diper, don't know they are doing this to reduce cost or what they are trying to achive without testing. It is matter of small baby and they just judging us like a customer. I request you all now don't buy it as it is creating red rashes and we have to visit doctor to gwt treatment of baby. Doctor just simple advise to change dipers, we have changed to another similar brand and now everything fine.\n\n",1.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 30 November 2019
\n\n  The huggies which i used to order before doesn't leak and have not faced any sort of issues but this time which i ordered seems to be newly launched diapers from huggies or fake diapers. Lookwise its good but starts to leak very soon and even starts to drip. It doesn't fulfill the requirement. May be this could be the reason they sold it in less price than before.\n\n,2.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 20 August 2019

"\n\n  Pathetic.. I would say.. used 10-12 diapers till now since bought.. out of them, 8 teared off while wearing. Disgusting material used.. do not stay more than 3 hours.. leaks.. i tried Huggies for the first time (always used pampers but tried Huggies cuz of price difference of 200 rs) and really disappointed. Will never buy it again.. though pampers are a bit costly than Huggies.. but all over because of its efficiency and good material, they are more cost effective to me than Huggies. And one more thing guyz.. I had to use only 4 pampers a day but now I am using 6 Huggies a day.. overall.. wastage of money. Amazon should discontinue it. As amazon has a good reputation but products like this are deteriorating it..\n\n",1.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 22 July 2020

I used to use all the time Huggies dry diapers, but once there were no stocks on online, then tried these pants immediately after using one the baby got rashes that 2 to 3 days were very problematic it was bad experiences, uploaded some images check those, it may be help full to you, Diaper cost only 1/4 amount but doctor cost four times more, Don't try this type of bubble bed. The bubble texture inside the pant was very irritated to the skin of the baby, Definitely. I don't recommend these bubble textured ones\n\n",1.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 29 January 2021
\n\n  Plz don\u2019t buy just coz film stars are endorsing this product. They don\u2019t use it.The product is soft definitely but it doesn\u2019t solve the actual purpose of absorbing or non leaky. After a single use the bubble layer feels wet & the channeling of liquid that the company is advertising is all rubbish & fake.It is not good as compared to Mamy poco pants & Pampers pants.So if you don\u2019t want your child to suffer plz don\u2019t buy.\n\n,1.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 10 January 2020
"\n\n  My baby is now 10 months old and I have been using this diaper for more than 9 months now.We were in endless search for a diaper for our new born. Our parents were always against the diapers and they were literally forcing me to use cotton cloth for the baby as they were in impression that diapers give rashes.. How wrong they were. Diapers absorb the wetness and helps to keep the baby dry. It helps in avoiding rasher, cold, time, effort, mess and what not.. \U0001f603\U0001f603So coming to this diaper, the diaper is actually what I was searching for. The diaper keeps the baby dry. It covers the entire backside of my baby. She is super comfortable in it. Before using Huggies wonder pants, We did use few different diapers as well. But, nothing worked as this this does.Overall, I am happy using this product and I do recommend this to others..\n\n",5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 20 December 2020
\n\n  Worst purchase again ... No good.Something is wrong this time. Diapers are not holding on even for three hours. This is irritating my kid during sleep and we need to change more than twice per night.Earlier diapers ordered were absolutely fine but not this time. Possibly the design fault which came up recently.Tested one by pourng 100ml water in the diaper and soon it became like a sack swollen completely.Considering other brands now.\n\n,1.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 24 July 2019

"\n\n  Huggies pants diapers are very soft esp near the waist region. It does not leave behind any mark. I have used Pampers pants diapers too for my baby but that's not as soft as Huggies and hence leaves a mark behind. Compared to Pampers, Huggies pants diapers are a bit bulky but still I prefer Huggies.It absorbs well and it's leak proof.But I would say don't wait for 12 hours to change your baby's diapers.\n\n",4.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 21 June 2020

"\n\n  My 9 months old baby has a sensitive skin and is 12 Kg and as Pampers premium is getting too costly I switched to huggies hoping for a better alternative.  This thing is causing my child eczema.  Heavy rashes I can't imagine how she must be bearing with it. This one says large is for maximum 14 kg babies which is wrong.  Large must be for younger babies or maximum till 10 kg not more than that.  I'll try xl size tomorrow. If it still causes rashes then I'll switch back to Pampers premium.  I never write a bad review and this is the first item which I actually wanted to let parents know who want to switch diapers due to some or the other reasons.Regards, A.pai\n\n",1.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 25 February 2021

"\n\n  It was by first experience with Huggies. Thought that it is one of the best in the market for babies but that was my mistake. Diapers lack absorbency and start leaking within 4-5 hours of usage and at times even lesser time though company claims 12 hours longevity.I have used Supples and Mamy poko pants for baby in the past but never faced such issue as both lasted well over 10-12 hours. Can't say if Huggies sell inferior diapers in megabox or generally their diapers are this bad. Out of 40 diapers used thus far from box, barely 4-5 diapers lasted 8-10 hours. Rest all leaked within 3-4 hours of usage or even in lesser time. Baby has also started experience rashes frequently. Just 1 suggestion for planning to buy this box - Avoid and look for other alternatives. Best 1 I can suggest is Supples though megabox option is not available but diapers are of premium quality.\n\n",1.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 8 December 2019
\n\n  The back sheet external surface (diaper outer surface) could use a better material. Diaper core top sheet seems to be fine with a mild lotion and smell that suits babies. The acquisition/distribution layer and absorbent core could use a better quality material to enhance fluid/dirt retention. Stretch side panel around the leg cuffs could use more constricting elastic material. The diaper kept moving to a side when my child moved causing my wife's clothes to get wet when he urinated.The waist fastening tapes work just fine.\n\n,4.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 7 August 2018
