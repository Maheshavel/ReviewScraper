\n\n  VERY BAD PRODUCT DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM AMAZON BUT FROM FIRST CRY FAR FAR BETTER QUALITY THIRD GRADE QUALITY .\n\n,1.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 13 September 2019
"\n\n  It is written 0-5 kg, but fits only for babies of 4-5 kg weight. Not used yet. If your new born is under 3 kg of weight, then without any second thought go for Pampers Pants, because thats the only diaper which will fit your baby\n\n",4.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 30 May 2020
\n\n  It is not mentioned on the pack that these are scented diapers. I don't know if it is good for newborns to use such strong fragrances.\n\n,3.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 11 April 2019
"\n\n  It becomes too heavy after two-three hrs or could vary depending on the baby. My baby was uncomfortable in it, and even woke from her sleep because of this.It takes a little time to absorb wetness.\n\n",1.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 13 February 2019
"\n\n  After some mixed reviews on the internet, I still thought of giving it a try to buy this product online. And I must say I am satisfied with the product. It does last upto 8-10 hours for my 1 month old baby without my baby feeling uncomfortable. I have provided 5 stars but I did find that 2-3 diapers in the complete pack of 24 did leak due to incorrect sealing of the diapers.\n\n",5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 24 June 2020
"\n\n  Best choice since day one for my baby.good absorbency, leak proof and great softness.was little worried about the mild fragrance of the diaper,using this nappy never caused diaper rash on her.but the other brands does.Highly recommendable!!\n\n",5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 28 October 2019
\n\n  I didn't like the product online.. I was using pampers for my baby.. I just switched to Huggies.. online Huggies product management guy be duplicate. Absorbing is not good.  Feels heavy ..baby doesn't sleep comfortable at night. I want to switch back to Pampers for my baby... Comfort is the first priority for baby.. can't compromise in that.\n\n,2.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 10 July 2019
\n\n  The NEW Huggies wonder pants are the best I've used for my little one so far. I've tried other brands but not as satisfied as I'm with this one. Completely rash free skin my baby's been habit since I used this andit has bery good absorbance. Doesn't leak either and last the whole night. Love this product and I definately recommend it for new borns especially. Huggies is batter than other brands diaper pants.....we have observed no rashesh by using this for whole night. Really soft for babies.i used mamy poko pants for my new born baby and he got rashes on his thighs then i ordered huggies pants through Amazon. Trust me these diapers are good for new born and more comfortable for your baby. Coz of its softness my baby didn't get any rash as i found mamy poko pants material little rough. Good diaper for new borns. Best thing is that it has wetness indicator. Another good thing is that it is leak proof. Dryness and absorption is also good but not as good as pampers. I couldn't find any wetness indicator in pampers. In all it is a good diaper for newborns who do not have potty routine as it is one of the cheapest option.\n\n,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 10 January 2021
"\n\n  For my newborn baby, I used Pampers diaper pants at first as I had used the same for my first kid abroad. But I didn't like the quality of Pampers in India. So bought Huggies to try. I must say I'm really impressed. It is soft and comfy, leak proof and absorbs urine quickly. I will be buying only Huggies here after.\n\n",5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 9 March 2020
"\n\n  Do you call it a diaper? Zero in absorbency and comfort. I had to change diaper after diaper all the night in every couple of hours. Still each time my baby was sleeping wet. Please don't sell such things in the name of diaper and play with baby's delicate skin. I used pampers, mamy poko , huggies ultra soft and Huggies wonder pants. Wonder pant is the worst one in this category. 0\n\n",1.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 15 October 2019
"\n\n  I think it's best in diaper category, absorbing capacity is more than 12 hours and much better than baby diaper product like pampers .....

"\n\n  Being a new father, this is the first time when I have purchased a diaper that too from an online platform. I saw too many reviews on this diaper but decided to trust the brand . Let me tell you it is worth the money.\xa0No leakage, good absorbency, no rashes, well fit and cost effective.Your baby can sleep 6 to 8 hours without any sign of uncomfortableness.

\n\n  Total waste of money... don't buy it 1st of all it was having a manufacturing defect diapers one side limb hole is bigger and another side is small i purchased 2 packs n in both it's the same. ..n absorbance power is also not that gud just after 1 n half hour of putting new diaper to my baby when I touch her diaper from outside I starts feeling cold like it's fully wet from inside I was able to feel n most important thing is it's not gel base ....so worst one\n\n,1.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 12 November 2019
\n\n  The pain point it addressed first was leak proof which was an annoying point with Pampers for the new born that would leak even when my baby pees for first time. This way I had to change multiple diapers which is absolutely a huge waste of money and marketing gimmick to get more diapers sold. Huggies does the job well without any leakage even after getting loaded with baby pee until 4-5 hours. The absorption is also good.\n\n,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 26 December 2020
\n\n  Size issue and less absorbency. I'm very disappointed since a big brand like Pampers are not able to design proper size and fitting as per a 15 days older baby. They claim to be the best quality but what matters first is the fit and size. This was XS size but it's still too large. The baby body size and health is normal.I'm too surprised when I recently bought a small company diapers and they're so perfectly fit and very comfortable and also cheaper than Pampers.I think such a big company should always see the usability of the product first rather than just launching new verieties daily and just claiming that they're the best in market.I'll rate 2.5 out of 5 here! Not satisfied!\n\n,2.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 26 March 2021

"\n\n  Huggies newborn diaper is best amongs all other brands in the market. I don't know why people have gave low rating to this product.

I would definitely recommend this to everyone.\n\n",5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 24 July 2020

\n\n  Product quality is not good after wearing this my daughter she is getting rashes and it is not staying longer for more hours only just for 3 hours.While when I was using mammy pants they stay for longer. This is my last order for huggies. So bad quality I had order 8 pack of 24 huggies don\u2019t know what will with those daipers. Wasted my money.\n\n,1.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 9 January 2020
\n\n  Bought these thinking of the brand name and brand image but they seem to be economical but if you use them you will end up changing diapers frequently which if calculated makes them costly because in comparison with other brands if you for example in  2 hours you change other brands once huggies will need 2-3 diaper change. So effectively they are not at all economical and more over chances of rash and all\n\n,2.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 15 October 2020

"\n\n  As a avid Pampers user, I was using Pampers new baby diapers, it's good, but due to some reason the poop will always leak, so I thought to give Huggies a try, the quality is good, everything felt good, but it pee leaked so much, I will hope for it to not leak when I put it on, the waist elastic is so soft that it gets pulled down and it starts to leak, maybe it will work for the babies who are on healthier side.\n\n",3.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 1 May 2021
